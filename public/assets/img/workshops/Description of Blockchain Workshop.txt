Blockchain technology is considered as one of the most popular catchphrases in recent times. The basic tenet of this platform is that it allows one to create a distributed and replicated ledger of events, transactions, and data generated through various IT processes with strong cryptographic guarantees of tamper resistance, immutability, and verifiability. Typically, Blockchain is a publicly verifiable, shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions, where a block is a data structure that contains a set of transactions, a hash of the previous block, timestamp, and so on. The information that is recorded in the blockchain cannot be tampered with unnoticed, which makes the blockchain a trusted ledger, relying on different consensus protocols (e.g. proof-of-work, proof-of-stake).

The Blockchain platform holds promise in various areas such as time stamping, logging of important events in a system, recording transactions, e-governance etc. The technology is being widely used in diverse industries such as Financial Services, Governance, healthcare, automobiles, media, travel, energy etc.
